**Introduction**

The 2000 US presidential election was one of the closest in history. The race was between the Republican nominee George W. Bush and Al Gore, the incumbent Democratic vice president. Florida was the tie-breaker state. Television networks’ predictions oscillated between both candidates as victors as votes were counted. At the end of counting, Bush was leading by only 1,738 votes. The narrow margin called for an immediate recount. When votes were recounted, it was revealed that Bush had actually led by less than 400 votes. This caused Democratic voters in Palm Beach County to complain about the design of the ballot as it had a “butterfly” layout, and that they had accidentally voted for the wrong candidate, Pat Buchanan.

Using statistical analysis, this case study seeks to suggest answers to the number of votes Buchanan could have reasonably expected to receive given a more user-friendly ballot. Using a linear regression model, with Buchanan votes as a function of Bush votes, this case study seeks to determine the predicted number of votes for Buchanan in Palm Beach County, assuming that the relationship between Bush votes and Buchanan votes was the same in Palm Beach as in the other Florida counties. This case study also aims to determine how many mis-cast votes there were since some voters erroneously voted Buchanan instead of Gore.

**Description of Data and Exploratory Data Analysis**

The dataset originates from the Statistical Sleuth data library. It consists of all total votes for Bush and Buchanan in the US 2000 presidential election for each county in Florida, which is 67 in total. The unit of observation is a vote cast in the United States 2000 presidential election. As Palm Beach County was a major outlier, it was removed from the data set to improve model accuracy. This brought the total observations to 66.

```

Based on Table 1, the minimum number of votes cast for Bush in any county was 1316, and the maximum was 289,456. Buchanan had a minimum of 9 votes cast in his favour in any county during the election and 3407. Bush’s median number of votes was significantly higher than Buchanan's at 20,196, while Buchanan had a median of 114. Bush had a mean of 43,356 votes, and Buchanan had a mean of 258.5 votes, indicating the typical total votes for a county. As we can see from the summary statistics, Bush consistently had more votes than Buchanan in the 2000 Presidential election.

The mean number of votes for both candidates is larger than the median number of votes, indicating an inflation of the mean by outlier total county votes. There are fewer outliers affecting the mean of Buchanan votes than that of Bush votes.

Figure 1 shows a considerable difference in the distribution of Buchanan votes compared to Bush votes. While both are right-skewed, the degree of skew on the plot of Buchanan votes is noticeably larger. Each county's total votes for Buchanan is less than 100,000. Total county votes for Bush ranged between the low hundred thousands and 200,000. The distribution indicates outlier total votes of around 300,000. The variation in the number of Bush votes across the counties of Florida is greater than that across Buchanan votes. To improve the skew of the distribution, a natural logarithmic transformation can be applied.

  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#A020F0", "#FF0000")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ind)
```

Figure 2 shows a clearer image of the distribution of Buchanan's votes by reducing the skew. The histogram of Buchanan votes shows a unimodal distribution, indicating a singular most frequent number of votes. The distribution of Bush votes shows a bimodal distribution, indicating two groups of votes with the highest frequency.

**Statistical Methods**

To estimate the relationship between the quantitative outcome variable, number of Buchanan votes and the quantitative explanatory variable, the number of Bush votes in the 2000 election, a simple linear regression model was employed. Using a linear regression model, we can also predict a more reasonable point estimate for Buchanan votes based on this relationship. Through intervals around the model's predicated point estimate, we can also determine a plausible number of votes that should have been in Gore. The model expresses Buchanan votes as a function of Bush votes.

Model for Predicting Buchanan votes from Bush votes

$$ E[log(Buchanan2000)|log(Bush2000)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1(log(Bush2000)) + \epsilon, $$

where log(Buchanan2000) is the natural logarithm of the number of votes Pat Buchanan received in the 2000 United States presidential election and log(Bush2000) is the natural logarithm of the number of votes George W. Bush received in the 2000 United States presidential election.

$$ log(\widehat{y}) = \widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1log(x) $$

The

$$ log(\widehat{y}) = -2.34149 + 0.73096(log(x)) $$
